Hi! I am Ferhat Can. I am graduated from Electrical-Electronics Enginnering at METU and I am currently working on master thesis with guidance of Prof. Dr. GÃ¶zde Akar. We are trying to investigate super-resolution methods on Infrared Images and we are going to seek a way to use visible spectrum image to improve the results. Both speed and accuracy are important for us.
