### WELCOME !!!

This is my first post. This blog will include my thesis works and blog posts. I will try to share my paper reviews, master thesis struggles, tests, implementations etc. I will also work on some topics that I want to improve myself. My interest areas are __Machine Learning__, __Deep Learning__, __Computer Vision__, __Algorithms & Data Structures__, __Python__, __Statistic__.

 My master-thesis topic is **Super-Resolution on Infrared Images with Fusing Visible Spectrum Images using Deep Learning**

 I am also working on __visual tracking__ for Machine Vision course project. Keep following ;). I am going to write a blog post about that.
